			As explained in the routes guide, an action is the code that handles a route.
When an incoming request matches a route, that route&rsquo;s action is executed.
 The scalatra-http-demo is a good place to start if you need to see basic requests and response, cookies, and dealing with form input.  Default behavior Each route is followed by an action. An Action may return any value, which is then rendered to the response according to the following rules.

			<br>
			AkkaSupport Akka is a toolkit and runtime for building highly concurrent, distributed, and fault tolerant event-driven applications on the JVM. Scalatra allows you to easily mix it into your application.
Dependencies The following dependencies will be needed to make the sample application work.
&quot;com.typesafe.akka&quot; %% &quot;akka-actor&quot; % &quot;2.3.9&quot;, &quot;net.databinder.dispatch&quot; %% &quot;dispatch-core&quot; % &quot;0.11.1&quot;,  Setting up your Scalatra app with Akka When you&rsquo;re using Akka, you&rsquo;ll want to start your Actors and ActorSystem from inside the ScalatraBootstrap class.

			AkkaSupport Akka is a toolkit and runtime for building highly concurrent, distributed, and fault tolerant event-driven applications on the JVM. Scalatra allows you to easily mix it into your application.
In versions of Scalatra before 2.2.0, Akka was an optional dependency, contained in a scalatra-akka jar. In Scalatra 2.2.0, Akka has been folded directly into Scalatra core, and the scalatra-akka dependency is no longer needed. To get access to Akka, all you need to do is mix FutureSupport into your servlets.

				<h2>Atmosphere</h2>
			</a>

			<br>
			Scalatra has a built-in integration with Atmosphere, the asynchronous websocket/comet framework. Atmosphere allows you to keep a persistent connection alive between the server and the user&rsquo;s browser (or other user-agents). You can push new information to your user at any time, without a page refresh.
Atmosphere example app  See scalatra-atmosphere-example for a minimal and standalone project containing the example in this guide.  Generating the app Generate a project using g8 scalatra/scalatra-sbt, and call your initial servlet ChatController.

				<h2>Authentication</h2>
			</a>

			<br>
			Scentry is Scalatra&rsquo;s optional authentication system. It is a port of Ruby&rsquo;s Warden authentication framework for Scalatra. You write auth strategies to meet your needs, and then use Scentry to enforce security for your strategies.
There are a few moving parts here. In order to protect your application&rsquo;s actions with Scentry, you need two things:
 a strategy to enforce security, let&rsquo;s call it YourStrategy. A strategy is a piece of logic which determines whether a user should be authenticated.

			<br>
			Cross origin resource sharing Scalatra allows you to mix the CorsSupport trait into your servlets if you need to do cross-origin resource sharing.
Adding CorsSupport allows all requests from anywhere, by default. You&rsquo;ll need to add an options route to your servlet, though, so that your servlet will respond to the preflight request:
import org.scalatra.CorsSupport class YourServlet extends ScalatraBase with CorsSupport { options(&quot;/*&quot;){ response.setHeader(&quot;Access-Control-Allow-Headers&quot;, request.getHeader(&quot;Access-Control-Request-Headers&quot;)); } }  You can configure your application to be more restrictive by using the following init params.

			Scalatra includes a very sophisticated set of validation commands.
These allow you to parse incoming data, instantiate command objects, and automatically apply validations to the objects. This sounds like it might be quite complex, but once you&rsquo;ve got the (quite minimal) infrastructure in place, it can dramatically simplify your code.

				<h2>Configuration</h2>
			</a>

			<br>
			As you develop, test, and get ready for final deployment, you&rsquo;ll need to configure things about your app: its environment, its settings, initial configurations when it starts up, and the software it depends on.
Configuring your app using the ScalatraBootstrap file As of 2.1.x, the ScalatraBootstrap file is the recommended way of configuring your application.

				<h2>Continuous integration</h2>

			<br>
			Continuous integration is the practice of having a build server regularly compile and test the latest code base. Using continuous integration has many advantages:
 Developers can be alerted by the build server when a recent commit will not compile (&ldquo;breaks the build&rdquo;) or fails tests. When development slows down, the build server continues to regularly download and compile the app, alerting developers to bit rot. In cases where a project&rsquo;s test suite takes a long time to run, the burden can be shifted to the build server by creating a temporary &ldquo;staging&rdquo; branch.

			Scalatra&rsquo;s philosophy is to keep things simple and solid. At its heart, Scalatra is basically a domain-specific language (DSL) for easily making HTTP requests, and a way of extending the core HTTP router with whatever libraries you want. We think we&rsquo;ve got a great DSL for HTTP - the Sinatra style strikes us as perhaps the simplest, most natural way to express HTTP routes.
Data is different. Every application has its own needs for persistence, and there&rsquo;s certainly no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of how to store data.

			URL support and reverse routes ScalatraBase provides two instances that provide you with relative URLs. The url method will return a string that can be used in your output or a redirect statement.
 The scalatra-http-demo is a good place to start if you&rsquo;d like to see working url-related examples.  In Scalatra 2.0.x, you used to need to extend the UrlSupport trait, but that&rsquo;s now been moved into ScalatraBase, so all you need is:

			Specs2 is a library for writing executable software specifications. With specs2 you can write software specifications for one class (unit specifications) or a full system (acceptance specifications).
Dependency &quot;org.scalatra&quot; %% &quot;scalatra-specs2&quot; % &quot;2.5.0&quot; % &quot;test&quot;  Examples Specs2 supports two basic styles: unit and acceptance. Both are supported by Scalatra.
Unit testing From the Specs2 QuickStart:
 unit specifications where the specification text is interleaved with the specification code. It is generally used to specify a single class.

			Squeryl is a Scala object-relational mapper and domain-specific language for talking to databases in a succinct and typesafe way.
We&rsquo;ll use Squeryl with C3P0, a &ldquo;butt-simple&rdquo; connection pooling library.
 See scalatra-squeryl for an example project which expands on the concepts explained in this guide.  Dependencies &quot;org.squeryl&quot; %% &quot;squeryl&quot; % &quot;0.9.5-6&quot;, &quot;com.h2database&quot; % &quot;h2&quot; % &quot;1.3.166&quot;, &quot;c3p0&quot; % &quot;c3p0&quot; % &quot;0.9.1.2&quot;  Set up a C3P0 connection pool Setting up C3P0 connection pool in Scalatra is just a matter of making a trait which does your database initialization.

			What is Swagger? Swagger is a specification which allows you to quickly define the functionality of a REST API using JSON documents. But it&rsquo;s more than just a spec. It provides automatic generation of interactive API docs, client-side code generation in multiple languages, and server-side code generation in Java and Scala.
